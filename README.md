Problem Statement![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94863545/142919824-89850d46-f39a-411e-85c3-5b5bc648434d.png)

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. 
Once people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead . X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. 
The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
